# Face-Recognition
Face Detection and Recognition model with OpenCV and Python. Works on realtime as well as recorded videos!  

# Introduction
This is a Face Recognition project which is based on Python 3.6 and OpenCV framework. It uses the fundamentals of Machine Learning specifically the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Algorithm for recognizing the captured faces by matching with earlier detected faces.

# How To Use
- Run the face_detect.py file. It'll first ask for Name and Count of pictures to be taken. Enter the name and count
- A "My Camera" window will open. If using a webcam to capture the image, stand in front of the camera and align the face properly. If "Chopped Image" window displays your face, you're ready to move to the next step.
- Press 'c' to captures the images. Do this for 'count' number of times. All the captured images will be stored in faces.npy file in a reshaped numpy array format.
- Run the face_recog.py file!
